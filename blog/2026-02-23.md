# Read less, but read it twice

I came across Rolf Dobelli's article: [Weniger lesen, aber aus Prinzip
doppelt](https://www.dobelli.com/de/essays/weniger-lesen/). _Read less, but out
of principle, twice_.

Before 40, read widely. Develop your taste.

After 40, read a new book for 10 minutes only. If it does not meet your standard, toss it.

If it pulls you in, read it twice.

Limit yourself to 10 books a year. Pathetically little. But books you will remember.
