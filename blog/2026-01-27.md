# First Entry

The obligatory first entry. While AI does more and more of your knowledge work for you, I believe the
satisfaction in (work) life comes from understanding things, the act of trying to
understand things (learning), and the drive to understand things (curiosity).

And to understand _things_, writing about those
_things_ is a good tool. 

So you get to suffer through that, lucky you.
