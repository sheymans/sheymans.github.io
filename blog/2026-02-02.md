> ...this is the reason. This is the thing. This is the thing, really. The act of making something is so good. It's so good.

Is this the feeling that gnaws at us, developers? That with AI we will still
make products, but that the act of making will change, lose purpose?  No longer
writing code by hand, but telling a machine what to do with natural language.
But is that not also _programming_? 

And literature and software products will both be produced by natural language?
And will it be your command of the language that will produce the most
compelling products? Or does the language not matter, has never mattered, but
your creativity is the determining factor?

Or is what is special about the act of making the time you invest as a maker?
The flow you reach? The purpose you feel.
