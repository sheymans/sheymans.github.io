# Karpathy on current state Claude coding

From [x](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876):

> I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December.

I have a similar experience. I did my first full PR without writing code
manually in July 2025. I combine that with heavy use of
[diffview](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file) in
neovim.

Diffing my code and iterating on that has always been my workflow: coding,
diff-ing, coding, diffing, ... Today, the coding is less code _writing_, but
telling Claude what code actions to take.
